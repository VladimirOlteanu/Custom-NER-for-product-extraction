    "In this Jupyter Notebook, I developed a custom NER (Name Entity Recognition) model using the latest version of Spacy. As an input to the model, I used the previously created annotations (in the [NER-Annotator](https://tecoholic.github.io/ner-annotator/)) and downloaded the configuration files from the Spacy website ([base_config.cfg](https://spacy.io/usage/training#config-overrides) - which contains the configurations of the Spacy model). The model used is Roberta - a transformer based architecture optimized for accuracy."

Scratches, dents, folds and marks occur naturally in the leather. We do not view these marks as defects. Please note that hue and color varies between hides. Since each side of leather is different, the shade and texture of the leather will vary with each chair. Please care for your Jack chairs with a soft cloth and leather cleaner. Please be advised that exposure to sunlight and water will darken the leather. Finish samples available upon request.\",\n",

Durable Fabrics Not only is the craftsmanship of our swings the highest level of quality, but we also choose the highest quality outdoor fabrics as well. We use a combination of Sunbrella Fabric and our in-house brand DuraCord Fabric. Sunbrella branded fabric is the foremost fabric in the outdoor industry made from 100% solution-dyed acrylic. Solution-dyed acrylic, which means the fibers of the fabric are dyed in color before they are woven into the fabric. Sunbrella is not printed or dyed after the fabric is made. Sunbrella is water-resistant and will not fade. You can even soak it in bleach and the color will remain the same. Which is why to use Sunbrella fabric on the tops of our swings. DuraCord is not only fast-drying but is also resistant to rot, mold, mildew, and staining, as well as Sunbrella. We use the DuraCord Fabric on the bottom of our Fabric swings because has better abrasion resistance than Sunbrella. DuraCord Rope Our own proprietary solution-dyed synthetic blend of rope, DuraCord, blends the softness of cotton with the durability of polyester. Made in the Carolinas, this combination yields a rope that has excellent color steadfastness and superior feel. DuraCord is dyed when spun, producing a rope that is colored all the way through. Like a carrot when sliced open, DuraCord has the same color on both the inside and the outside. Oak Spreader Bar A wood that is naturally resistant to both rot and insect infestation, and has oils that repel water, Oak blends both exceptional strength and a handsome appearance. Our Oak spreader bars are repeatedly hand-dipped in honey-gold marine-grade varnish allowing a longer outdoor life and exceptional good looks. Our Oak spreader bars are a full 1 inch thick, compared to most other competitors.  A thicker spreader bar allows for more stability, allowing the Swing Cushion to sit firmly between the Ring knots. Our spreader bars also feature countersink drilled holes. Countersink drilling is a technique that uses a trumpet drill bit that produces a hole with no hard angles, allowing the rope to pass through without any sharp edges to wear the rope. Rolled Rim Grommets with Spur Washers We are very particular with every aspect of our swings even down to the grommets on all our fabric swings. Every grommet we use has tiny spurs on the back of the connecting washer forcing part of the fabric into the lip of the grommet itself, creating a more secure bond. We have also experimented with making the fabric around the grommet stronger by sewing an ï¿½Xï¿½ï¿½ on the fabric before placing the grommet, by adding that extra stitching it gives those tiny spurs more fabric to grip onto. The industry standard, however, is the telescoping grommet, which our testing has shown rips lose from the fabric before the rolled-rim grommet every time. We plate all our hanging hardware with Zinc Plated Coating, including Hanging bracket that comes standard with our single swings. The zinc-plated coating prevents the accumulation of rust and ensures a longer outdoor life. Our very own One-piece ring-knot and chain, a product of years of development, permanently attaches the chain to the O-ring. This produces a swing that is more durable and most importantly makes it impossible to lose the chain. Non-absorbent Padding Each of our Single Cushioned Swings are filled with a non-absorbent 1.5ï¿½ï¿½ Urethane Foam that is sewn in between the two layers of fabric. The foam adds a pillow-like softness to the already comfortable fabric seat. The Foam Center is a nonabsorbent material allowing water to drain through and provide quick drying.',\n",

    " (\"Picture yourself on a beach, listening to sound of ocean waves, seagulls chirping, and the feeling of a cool ocean breeze in your face, wasting the day away in pure relaxation bliss. The Deluxe Cushion Swing in Midori Indigo is the first step to creating this relaxation experience in the comfort of your own backyard! The top fabric layer of our Midori Indigo Deluxe Cushion Double Swing is made from solution-dyed synthetic Sunbrella fabric and a neutral-colored bottom layer made from our quick-drying Duracord fabric. These two synthetics sandwich a lavish center of resilient, nonabsorbent polyester hollow-fill fiber manufactured from recycled plastic drink bottles. For our Hatteras Hammock wood frame, we use a toasted almond-brown Brazilian Teak Cumaru that's been sanded to a soft finish. Cumaru is one of the strongest wooden materials around, and looks great as well! Our hardware is zinc plated steel, for quality rust protection. Even though Hatteras Hammocks are extremely strong and weather-resistant, we do always recommend storing it in an enclosed dry place away from any overly-harsh weather, hungry wildlife and other lingering periods when it's going unused, to ensure its longest possible life. Durable Fabrics Not only is the craftsmanship of our Deluxe Double Swings the highest level of quality, but we also choose the highest quality outdoor fabrics as well. We use a combination of Sunbrella Fabric and our in-house brand DuraCord Fabric. Sunbrella branded fabric is the foremost fabric in the outdoor industry made from 100% solution dyed acrylic.

Sunbrella is water resistant and will not fade. You can even soak it in bleach and the color will remain the same. Which is why to use Sunbrella fabric on the tops of our deluxe double swings. DuraCord is not only fast-drying but is also resistant to rot, mold, mildew, and staining, as well as Sunbrella. We use the DuraCord Fabric on the bottom of our double swings because DuraCord has better abrasion resistance than Sunbrella. Cumaru Wood Frame A Brazilian hardwood similar to teak, Cumaru, is 5 times harder and denser than pine, cedar, and redwood. Our Cumaru hardwood has a history of outstanding outdoor performance. Even after years of use, our Cumaru hardwood ages naturally to a beautiful silver grey without losing any of its durability. Exclusive to Hatteras Hammocks and is by far the best natural wood used in a porch swing on the market. Eco-Friendly Made from recycled soda bottles, our polyester fiberfill is stuffed between two layers of durable fabric. The recycled fiberfill is non-absorbent, allowing water to drain easily and provide quick dying. Our goal is to repurpose recyclable materials as much as possible and leave a smaller carbon footprint. We plate all our hanging hardware with Zinc Plated Coating, including both hanging hooks that come standard with our deluxe double swings. The zinc plated coating prevents the accumulation of rust and ensures a longer outdoor life.\",\n",

    " ('Scrambler Sectional Sofa Scrambler Sectional Sofa Scrambler Sectional Sofa Inspired by the trend of scrambler motorcycles which began in the UK; everyday road bikes customised by racers to perform on any terrain. The same ideology of customisation and versatility was applied to the Scrambler sectional sofa, beginning with the seat comfort, which is designed with an initial soft layer transitioning to a more supportive and incredibly comfortable sit, reflecting the modified seat suspension of the motorcycles. The leather is perforated on the seat and seat back, finished off with a light distress to mimic vintage motorcycle riding leathers. The side table was inspired by the clutch plates of a transmission, with exposed weld marks to embody the raw machinery of the original scramblers. Just as scrambler motorcycles evolved to conquer any terrain, the Scrambler sectional can be customised in a range of configurations to conquer any space. Scrambler is available worldwide.
