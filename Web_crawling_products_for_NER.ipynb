For this reason, his designs celebrate process and craftsmanship, and accentuate components and joinery to create functional pieces with spirit and personality. In recent years, Goodrum’s work has been awarded a host of design accolades including the NGV Rigg Prize, Vogue x Alessi Design Prize, Indesign Luminary Award and the Idea Awards Editor’s Medal.

Please contact us if you have a difficult access and we will work together on the best solution. Furniture Inspection We do not use any common carrier freight companies for any of our Amish Furniture. We choose to only work with experienced individual drivers that really know how to handle high quality furniture. All of our Amish Furniture is also heavily wrapped in blankets during the shipping and delivery process. Because of these precautions, shipping damage is extremely low. It is your responsibility to inspect your furniture to ensure that it has not been damaged during delivery. The furniture should be unpackaged before the delivery team leaves your residence to ensure there is no damage. If damage has occurred, please contact us immediately - while the delivery team is still at your residence. The quickest and most appropriate solution may be to bring the item back to the shop right away. Any damage not reported within 24 hours of delivery will not be covered. Build Times As soon as you complete your purchase with QW Furniture, your order is sent immediately for production. Please see the individual product pages for detailed build time estimates. Stated expected lead times are our best estimation based on current information and are not guaranteed. * Due to unprecedented global supply chain challenges, we have been experiencing some delays. Please remember our furniture is built by hand and must pass rigorous quality checks. The build process doesn't happen overnight but we do take great pride in the quality of our furniture and strive to meet our posted build times. Cancellation is not permitted due to a build time delay. Cancellation Requests If you wish to cancel your order, you may do so up to 3 days after placing your order for a full refund. Refunds will be issued back onto the same payment method used during the initial order process. Cancellation requests after 3 days may not be accepted due to work having begun your order. A 30% restocking fee to cancel after the 3 day period may apply. Returns First and foremost, we take care of our customers. We would not have a 4.7 star review rating on Google if we didn't. Our return policy is as follows: 7 day return policy for in-stock items. If an in-stock purchase is returned in-store within 7 days you will be eligible for a full refund. If 7 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately we can’t offer you a refund or exchange. If your item is a special order, a 30% re-stocking fee will apply if returned within 7 days.

              " 'The Bayswater Armchair The Bayswater Armchair design has been gracing drawing rooms for nearly 150 years. This elegantly proportioned design classic was made by Howard and Sons and named the ‘Bridgewater’. Built and finished just as the model was in the 19th Century with hand-tied coil springs and hand-sewn down-filled sac-a-duvet cushions. Compact yet supremely comfortable, the Bayswater is perfectly at home gracing a drawing room yet equally at home nestling in the corner of a cottage bedroom. Height: 90cm (35\") Width: 74cm (29\") Depth: 102cm (40\") Amount of plain fabric required: 8m The price excludes fabric. For patterned fabric meterage and bespoke sizes, get in touch and we can advise on quantities. Please get in touch with us to confirm our current lead times. Price shown is inclusive of VAT. We build our armchairs up from a hardwood beech frame, using traditional methods and materials. With hand-tied coil-sprung seat, arms and back. Where cushions are used, what makes them so comfortable is the high down content (50% down, 50% feather in seat, and 70% down, 30% feather in back). The down gives the cushions lovely softness, while the feathers provide loft and spring. Where castors are used, they have been individually hand-cast by traditional English metal crafters to a very high standard, and a variety of finishes can be achieved. We use the antique brass finish as standard. Where legs are used, they can be either tapered or turned and come in a variety of woods and finishes (see \\'Leg Options\\' tab for more details). We use medium oak as standard. All of our furniture can be made completely bespoke. We want this to be your perfect armchair, so if you want it a bit bigger or smaller, softer or firmer, or anything else just ask we will do our best to accommodate. The price excludes fabric. If you need some help finding the perfect fabric, let us know. Fabric quantities for standard models in plain fabric are shown in the product description.

              " '*Stand Sold Separately. Though compact, our Expand Dove Cushioned Single Swing packs plenty of other craftsmanship perks as well a 40-inch polished oak spreader bar, hammock-style clew knots securing the spray of hanging ropes to zinc-plated hanging rings, two rows of brass-colored rolled-rim grommets and a double lockstitched border of the same solid-color fabric as the seatback. Durable Fabrics Not only is the craftsmanship of our swings the highest level of quality, but we also choose the highest quality outdoor fabrics as well. We use a combination of Sunbrella® Fabric and our in-house brand DuraCord® Fabric. Sunbrella branded fabric is the foremost fabric in the outdoor industry made from 100% solution-dyed acrylic. Solution-dyed acrylic, which means the fibers of the fabric are dyed in color before they are woven into the fabric. Sunbrella is not printed or dyed after the fabric is made. Sunbrella® is water-resistant and will not fade. You can even soak it in bleach and the color will remain the same. Which is why to use Sunbrella® fabric on the tops of our swings. DuraCord® is not only fast-drying but is also resistant to rot, mold, mildew, and staining, as well as Sunbrella. We use the DuraCord Fabric on the bottom of our Fabric swings because has better abrasion resistance than Sunbrella. DuraCord Rope Our own proprietary solution-dyed synthetic blend of rope, DuraCord, blends the softness of cotton with the durability of polyester. Made in the Carolinas, this combination yields a rope that has excellent color steadfastness and superior feel. DuraCord is dyed when spun, producing a rope that is colored all the way through. Like a carrot when sliced open, DuraCord has the same color on both the inside and the outside. Oak Spreader Bar A wood that is naturally resistant to both rot and insect infestation, and has oils that repel water, Oak blends both exceptional strength and a handsome appearance. Our Oak spreader bars are repeatedly hand-dipped in honey-gold marine-grade varnish allowing a longer outdoor life and exceptional good looks. Our Oak spreader bars are a full 1 inch thick, compared to most other competitor’s spreader bars that measure at ⅞ inch. A thicker spreader bar allows for more stability, allowing the Swing Cushion to sit firmly between the Ring knots. Our spreader bars also feature countersink drilled holes. Countersink drilling is a technique that uses a trumpet drill bit that produces a hole with no hard angles, allowing the rope to pass through without any sharp edges to wear the rope. Rolled Rim Grommets with Spur Washers We are very particular with every aspect of our swings even down to the grommets on all our fabric swings. Every grommet we use has tiny spurs on the back of the connecting washer forcing part of the fabric into the lip of the grommet itself, creating a more secure bond. We have also experimented with making the fabric around the grommet stronger by sewing an “X” on the fabric before placing the grommet, by adding that extra stitching it gives those tiny spurs more fabric to grip onto. The industry standard, however, is the telescoping grommet, which our testing has shown rips lose from the fabric before the rolled-rim grommet every time. Hardware We plate all our hanging hardware with Zinc Plated Coating, including Hanging bracket that comes standard with our single swings. The zinc-plated coating prevents the accumulation of rust and ensures a longer outdoor life. Our very own One-piece ring-knot and chain, a product of years of development, permanently attaches the chain to the O-ring. This produces a swing that is more durable and most importantly makes it impossible to lose the chain. Non-absorbent Padding Each of our Single Cushioned Swings are filled with a non-absorbent 1.5” Urethane Foam that is sewn in between the two layers of fabric. The foam adds a pillow-like softness to the already comfortable fabric seat. The Foam Center is a nonabsorbent material allowing water to drain through and provide quick drying.',\n",

The Deluxe Cushion Swing in Midori Indigo is the first step to creating this relaxation experience in the comfort of your own backyard! The top fabric layer of our Midori Indigo Deluxe Cushion Double Swing is made from solution-dyed synthetic Sunbrella fabric and a neutral-colored bottom layer made from our quick-drying Duracord fabric. These two synthetics sandwich a lavish center of resilient, nonabsorbent polyester hollow-fill fiber manufactured from recycled plastic drink bottles. For our Hatteras Hammock wood frame, we use a toasted almond-brown Brazilian Teak Cumaru that's been sanded to a soft finish. Cumaru is one of the strongest wooden materials around, and looks great as well! Our hardware is zinc plated steel, for quality rust protection. Even though Hatteras Hammocks are extremely strong and weather-resistant, we do always recommend storing it in an enclosed dry place away from any overly-harsh weather, hungry wildlife and other lingering periods when it's going unused, to ensure its longest possible life.

Even after years of use, our Cumaru hardwood ages naturally to a beautiful silver grey without losing any of its durability. Exclusive to Hatteras Hammocks and is by far the best natural wood used in a porch swing on the market. Eco-Friendly Made from recycled soda bottles, our polyester fiberfill is stuffed between two layers of durable fabric. The recycled fiberfill is non-absorbent, allowing water to drain easily and provide quick dying. Our goal is to repurpose recyclable materials as much as possible and leave a smaller carbon footprint.

Durable Fabrics Not only is the craftsmanship of our swings the highest level of quality, but we also choose the highest quality outdoor fabrics as well. We use a combination of Sunbrella® Fabric and our in-house brand DuraCord® Fabric. Sunbrella branded fabric is the foremost fabric in the outdoor industry made from 100% solution-dyed acrylic. Solution-dyed acrylic, which means the fibers of the fabric are dyed in color before they are woven into the fabric. Sunbrella is not printed or dyed after the fabric is made. Sunbrella® is water-resistant and will not fade. You can even soak it in bleach and the color will remain the same. Which is why to use Sunbrella® fabric on the tops of our swings. DuraCord® is not only fast-drying but is also resistant to rot, mold, mildew, and staining, as well as Sunbrella. We use the DuraCord Fabric on the bottom of our Fabric swings because has better abrasion resistance than Sunbrella. DuraCord Rope Our own proprietary solution-dyed synthetic blend of rope, DuraCord, blends the softness of cotton with the durability of polyester. Made in the Carolinas, this combination yields a rope that has excellent color steadfastness and superior feel. DuraCord is dyed when spun, producing a rope that is colored all the way through. Like a carrot when sliced open, DuraCord has the same color on both the inside and the outside. Oak Spreader Bar A wood that is naturally resistant to both rot and insect infestation, and has oils that repel water, Oak blends both exceptional strength and a handsome appearance. Our Oak spreader bars are repeatedly hand-dipped in honey-gold marine-grade varnish allowing a longer outdoor life and exceptional good looks. Our Oak spreader bars are a full 1 inch thick, compared to most other competitor’s spreader bars that measure at ⅞ inch. A thicker spreader bar allows for more stability, allowing the Swing Cushion to sit firmly between the Ring knots. Our spreader bars also feature countersink drilled holes. Countersink drilling is a technique that uses a trumpet drill bit that produces a hole with no hard angles, allowing the rope to pass through without any sharp edges to wear the rope. Rolled Rim Grommets with Spur Washers We are very particular with every aspect of our swings even down to the grommets on all our fabric swings. Every grommet we use has tiny spurs on the back of the connecting washer forcing part of the fabric into the lip of the grommet itself, creating a more secure bond. We have also experimented with making the fabric around the grommet stronger by sewing an “X” on the fabric before placing the grommet, by adding that extra stitching it gives those tiny spurs more fabric to grip onto. The industry standard, however, is the telescoping grommet, which our testing has shown rips lose from the fabric before the rolled-rim grommet every time. Hardware We plate all our hanging hardware with Zinc Plated Coating, including Hanging bracket that comes standard with our single swings. The zinc-plated coating prevents the accumulation of rust and ensures a longer outdoor life. Our very own One-piece ring-knot and chain, a product of years of development, permanently attaches the chain to the O-ring. This produces a swing that is more durable and most importantly makes it impossible to lose the chain. Non-absorbent Padding Each of our Single Cushioned Swings are filled with a non-absorbent 1.5” Urethane Foam that is sewn in between the two layers of fabric. The foam adds a pillow-like softness to the already comfortable fabric seat. The Foam Center is a nonabsorbent material allowing water to drain through and provide quick drying.',\n",

Open your eyes and realize that you can have just that with the Echo Limelight Tufted Single Swing. Calming earth tones and a unique pattern are handmade in the USA from two layers of Sunbrella fabric, known for it's cotton-like softness and unmatched durability, being resistant to fading, staining, mold, and mildew, providing you with a worry-free place to relax. DuraCord rope leads to a Cumaru spreader bar to create a seat that's comfortable, maintains its shape, and is easy to get in and out of. The DuraCord rope is designed for outdoor use, blending strength and style into a rope that won't degrade from exposure to the elements. Cumaru is amongst the hardest woods on the planet and slowly ages from a warm brown to a cool, coastal silvery-grey, giving your swing a unique look that can't be matched. Transform your patio space with the Echo Limelight tufted single swing; it provides hours of relaxation and is the perfect way to take your personal enjoyment of your outdoor space to the next level. So what are you waiting for? Durable Fabrics Not only is the craftsmanship of our swings the highest level of quality, but we also choose the highest quality outdoor fabrics as well. We use a combination of Sunbrella® Fabric and our in-house brand DuraCord® Fabric. Sunbrella branded fabric is the foremost fabric in the outdoor industry made from 100% solution dyed acrylic. Solution-dyed acrylic, which means the fibers of the fabric are dyed in color before they are woven into the fabric. Sunbrella is not printed or dyed after the fabric is made. Sunbrella® is water resistant and will not fade. You can even soak it in bleach and the color will remain the same. Which is why to use Sunbrella® fabric on the tops of our swings. DuraCord® is not only fast-drying but is also resistant to rot, mold, mildew, and staining, as well as Sunbrella. We use the DuraCord Fabric on the bottom of our Fabric Swings because DuraCord has better abrasion resistance than Sunbrella. DuraCord Rope Our own proprietary solution-dyed synthetic blend of rope, DuraCord, blends the softness of cotton with the durability of polyester. Made in the Carolinas, this combination yields a rope that has excellent color steadfastness and superior feel. DuraCord is dyed when spun, producing a rope that is colored all the way through. Like a carrot when sliced open, DuraCord has the same color on both the inside and the outside. Our DuraCord rope is the densest rope on the swing market at 85 ft./lb., this results in less stretching and increased support when relaxing in your swing. Cumaru Spreader Bar A Brazilian hardwood similar to teak, Cumaru, is 5 times harder and denser than pine, cedar, and redwood. Exclusive to Hatteras Hammocks, our Cumaru hardwood has a history of outstanding outdoor performance. Even after years of use, our Cumaru hardwood ages naturally to a beautiful silver grey without losing any of its durability. Our Cumaru Spreader bars are a full 1 inch thick, compared to most other competitor’s spreader bars that measure at ⅞ inch. Our spreader bars also feature countersink drilled holes. Countersink drilling is a technique that uses a trumpet drill bit that produces a hole with no hard angles, allowing the rope to pass through without any sharp edges to wear the rope. Rolled Rim Grommets with Spur Washers We are very particular with every aspect of our swings even down to the grommets on all our tufted swings. Every grommet we use has tiny spurs on the back of the connecting washer forcing part of the fabric into the lip of the grommet itself, creating a more secure bond. We have also experimented with making the fabric around the grommet stronger by sewing an “X” on the fabric before placing the grommet, by adding that extra stitching it gives those tiny spurs more fabric to grip onto. The industry standard, however, is the telescoping grommet, which our testing has shown rips lose from fabric before the rolled-rim grommet every time. Eco-Friendly Made from recycled soda bottles, our polyester fiberfill is stuffed between two layers of durable fabric. The recycled fiberfill is non-absorbent, allowing water to drain easily and provide quick dying. Our goal is to repurpose recyclable materials as much as possible and leave a smaller carbon footprint. Hardware We plate all our hanging hardware with Zinc Plated Coating, including both tree hooks that come standard with our swings. The zinc plated coating prevents the accumulation of rust and ensures a longer outdoor life.

Every grommet we use has tiny spurs on the back of the connecting washer forcing part of the fabric into the lip of the grommet itself, creating a more secure bond. We have also experimented with making the fabric around the grommet stronger by sewing an “X” on the fabric before placing the grommet, by adding that extra stitching it gives those tiny spurs more fabric to grip onto. The industry standard, however, is the telescoping grommet, which our testing has shown rips lose from fabric before the rolled-rim grommet every time. Eco-Friendly Made from recycled soda bottles, our polyester fiberfill is stuffed between two layers of durable fabric. The recycled fiberfill is non-absorbent, allowing water to drain easily and provide quick dying. Our goal is to repurpose recyclable materials as much as possible and leave a smaller carbon footprint. Hardware We plate all our hanging hardware with Zinc Plated Coating, including both tree hooks that come standard with our swings. The zinc plated coating prevents the accumulation of rust and ensures a longer outdoor life. Our very own One-piece ring-knot and chain, a product of years of development, permanently attaches the chain to the O-ring. This produces a swing that is more durable and most importantly makes it impossible to lose the chain. .\",\n",
              " \"*Stand Sold Separately. A comfortable place to sit, the sun setting as you sip on a cold drink, rocking gently on the patio in your new favorite chair. Open your eyes and realize that you can have just that with the Echo Sangria Tufted Single Swing. Calming earth tones and a unique pattern are handmade in the USA from two layers of Sunbrella fabric, known for it's cotton-like softness and unmatched durability, being resistant to fading, staining, mold, and mildew, providing you with a worry-free place to relax. DuraCord rope leads to a Cumaru spreader bar to create a seat that's comfortable, maintains its shape, and is easy to get in and out of. The DuraCord rope is designed for outdoor use, blending strength and style into a rope that won't degrade from exposure to the elements. Cumaru is amongst the hardest woods on the planet and slowly ages from a warm brown to a cool, coastal silvery-grey, giving your swing a unique look that can't be matched. Transform your patio space with the Echo Sangria tufted single swing; it provides hours of relaxation and is the perfect way to take your personal enjoyment of your outdoor space to the next level. So what are you waiting for? Durable Fabrics Not only is the craftsmanship of our swings the highest level of quality, but we also choose the highest quality outdoor fabrics as well. We use a combination of Sunbrella® Fabric and our in-house brand DuraCord® Fabric. Sunbrella branded fabric is the foremost fabric in the outdoor industry made from 100% solution dyed acrylic. Solution-dyed acrylic, which means the fibers of the fabric are dyed in color before they are woven into the fabric. Sunbrella is not printed or dyed after the fabric is made. Sunbrella® is water resistant and will not fade. You can even soak it in bleach and the color will remain the same. Which is why to use Sunbrella® fabric on the tops of our swings. DuraCord® is not only fast-drying but is also resistant to rot, mold, mildew, and staining, as well as Sunbrella. We use the DuraCord Fabric on the bottom of our Fabric Swings because DuraCord has better abrasion resistance than Sunbrella. DuraCord Rope Our own proprietary solution-dyed synthetic blend of rope, DuraCord, blends the softness of cotton with the durability of polyester. Made in the Carolinas, this combination yields a rope that has excellent color steadfastness and superior feel. DuraCord is dyed when spun, producing a rope that is colored all the way through. Like a carrot when sliced open, DuraCord has the same color on both the inside and the outside. Our DuraCord rope is the densest rope on the swing market at 85 ft./lb., this results in less stretching and increased support when relaxing in your swing. Cumaru Spreader Bar A Brazilian hardwood similar to teak, Cumaru, is 5 times harder and denser than pine, cedar, and redwood. Exclusive to Hatteras Hammocks, our Cumaru hardwood has a history of outstanding outdoor performance. Even after years of use, our Cumaru hardwood ages naturally to a beautiful silver grey without losing any of its durability. Our Cumaru Spreader bars are a full 1 inch thick, compared to most other competitor’s spreader bars that measure at ⅞ inch. Our spreader bars also feature countersink drilled holes. Countersink drilling is a technique that uses a trumpet drill bit that produces a hole with no hard angles, allowing the rope to pass through without any sharp edges to wear the rope.

              " 'Born to a baker, and orphaned at age twelve, Florence Schust grew up Saginaw, Michigan. Schust demonstrated an early interest in architecture and was enrolled at the Kingswood School for Girls, adjacent to the Cranbrook Academy of Art. While at Kingswood, Florence befriended Eilel Saarinen, whom she would later study under at Cranbrook. Warmly embraced by the Saarinen family, Florence seeded in Michigan the foundations of her incredible design education and pioneering career. Florence went on to study under some of the greatest 20th century architects, including Gropius, Breuer, and Mies. In 1941 Florence moved to New York where she met Hans Knoll who was establishing his furniture company. With Florence’s design skills and Hans’ business acumen and salesmanship, the pair, who married in 1946, grew the nascent company into an international arbiter of style and design. In creating the revolutionary Knoll Planning Unit, Florence Knoll defined the standard for the modern corporate interiors of post-war America. After the tragic death of Hans Knoll in 1955, Florence Knoll led the company as president through uncertain times. In 1960 she resigned the presidency to focus on directing design and development and, in 1965 after pioneering an industry and defining the landscape and aesthetic of the corporate office, Florence Knoll Bassett (she remarried in 1957) retired from the company. Her contributions to Knoll, and to the rise of modernism in America, are immeasurable.',\n",
              " 'As head of the Knoll Planning unit, Florence Knoll always approached furniture design with the larger space in mind. Most important to her was how a piece fit into the greater design — the room, the floor, the building. Every element of a Knoll-planned space supported the overall design and complemented the existing architecture. Never one to compromise, Florence would often design furniture when she, “needed the piece of furniture for a job and it wasn’t there.” And while she never regarded herself as a furniture designer, her quest for harmony of space and consistency of design led her to design several of Knoll’s most iconic pieces—all simple, none plain. As skyscrapers rose up across America during the post-war boom, Florence Knoll saw it as her job to translate the vocabulary and rationale of the modern exterior to the interior space of the corporate office. Thus, unlike Saarinen and Bertoia, her designs were architectural in foundation, not sculptural. She scaled down the rhythm and details of modern architecture while humanizing them through color and texture. Her lounge collection, designed in 1954, is a perfect example of her restrained, geometric approach to furniture, clearly derived from her favorite mentor, Mies van der Rohe.',\n",

              " 'Prior to the pioneering approach of Florence Knoll and the Knoll Planning Unit, executive offices in America were nearly all planned the same way. Florence Knoll described this standard layout in her 1964 “Commercial Interiors” entry for the Encyclopedia Britannica: “In such an office there was always a diagonally-placed desk, with a table set parallel behind it, a few chairs scattered around the edge of the room, and a glassed in bookcase. The table behind the desk generally became an unsightly storage receptacle.” Seeking to create a space better suited to the executive’s primary function — communication — Florence reconsidered the illogical layout from an architectural perspective. She eliminated the imposing desk, replacing it with the more inviting table desk, placed parallel to the back wall. Storage was moved to behind the table in a low, matching credenza. To execute this new layout, Florence introduced the 2544 Credenza in 1961. The elegant design exuded executive quality, and clearly exhibited Mies van der Rohe’s impact on Florence’s approach to design. Design historian Bobbye Tigerman notes that, “the furniture is architecture miniaturized…The structure of a large case balanced on thin peripheral columns recalls Mies’ Seagram Building.” Like Mies, Florence Knoll would endlessly refine each detail of a design in order to achieve simple, seemingly effortless beauty.',\n",

With Jorca Office Chairs, adjustment on the backrest tilt tension is effortless thanks to its intuitive weight response feature. This innovative backrest tension mechanism from Donati, Italy, has the capability to sense the user’s weight and auto-calibrate the necessary pressure required from the user to tilt the backrest. Both the Midback and Highback versions now come at promotional prices. Concerned about the wheels scratching your flooring? Consider getting a PVC Floor Mat for added protection.

The same ideology of customisation and versatility was applied to the Scrambler sectional sofa, beginning with the seat comfort, which is designed with an initial soft layer transitioning to a more supportive and incredibly comfortable sit, reflecting the modified seat suspension of the motorcycles. The leather is perforated on the seat and seat back, finished off with a light distress to mimic vintage motorcycle riding leathers. The side table was inspired by the clutch plates of a transmission, with exposed weld marks to embody the raw machinery of the original scramblers. Just as scrambler motorcycles evolved to conquer any terrain, the Scrambler sectional can be customised in a range of configurations to conquer any space. Scrambler is available worldwide.

              " 'as seen in Washington Spaces Written by Trish Donnally Photography by Morgan Howarth After living in Potomac, MD, for 27 years, in a 4,500-square-foot farmhouse that was close to a century old and brimming with antiques and art, David and Flora Kanter made a dramatic change. With their three daughters grown and maintenance of the house becoming a larger task, the couple bought a 2,700-square-foot condominium and filled it with modern furnishings and local art. The idea of the Kanters’ move came in stages. First, David relocated his law office from Dupont Circle in Washington, DC, to Chevy Chase, MD. Then, gazing out the window from his new perch, the native Washingtonian noticed construction of Chase Point Condominium beginning across the street, just inside the DC line. In the Family “I have no interest in retiring, so I thought a good compromise would be to get the stress of the commute out,” says David, founding senior partner of Kanter & Wishnow, Chartered. “But we understood that if we were going to move, it would be for a lifestyle change. We were not just moving to a smaller house,” he says. “An urban environment was the absolute appeal.” While David was excited about the prospect of moving and enjoyed watching the progress of the PN Hoffman building daily, Flora, an artist and art consultant, resisted the change at first. She had loved rearing her daughters and entertaining in her old house with its great character. “I had a house full of antiques; what was I going to do with all that here? This was a totally different look,” Flora says. The Kanters held an estate sale and started with a clean slate. And who better to consult than their style-savvy niece, Janice Kanter, interior designer/buyer and one of the principals of Theodores? Her father is the Theodore, founder of Theodores modern furniture store, and David’s brother. Her grandfather, Mike Kanter, also owned a store, I.C. Furniture on H Street in Northeast Washington, DC, in the 1950s and ’60s. Inspired By Art Flora and David’s collection of paintings by local artists launched the design of their new home. “The art was key,” Flora says. Janice designed their condominium working only from floor plans because the building was yet to be completed. “They bought the unit because it afforded them walls, which they needed for their art. A lot of the others had so much glass,” says Janice, who suggested neutral furnishings and wall coverings. “I knew the art, and a lot of it had color and movement. This backdrop let us go anywhere and just let the art speak,” she says. While most of the furnishings are new and available through Theodores, a few favorite pieces made the transition. Janice complemented their existing round dining table by Guy Chaddock, for instance, with banquettes that echo the curve of the table. When they expand the table with leaves, and pull up extra chairs, the couple can comfortably seat 12. Flora adores her new lifestyle. “I have come around. It’s wonderful to walk outside, go to a movie, and go grab dinner somewhere. I’m ‘citified’,” she says. Through an Art Consultant’s Eye For the last 11 years, Flora Kanter and her partner, Pamela Frederick, of ArtSPACE Management LLC, have placed original local artwork in residential and corporate environments, including The Residences at The Ritz-Carlton in Georgetown. “A lot of people have art and don’t know what to do with it. There are so many things you can do with artwork to make it come alive,” she says. Among Flora’s suggestions: - The simpler the frame, the better. A fancier frame often competes with the image. - Change the framing and matting. - Hang similar paintings in a series over a low table; this placement strengthens the artwork. - Improve the lighting to make the piece more visible. - Reposition – look at where art is hanging and consider whether it’s in the best position. “Most people tend to hang things too high and they look like they’re floating up to the ceiling. In my opinion, art looks better hanging lower. It’s the proportion of the art to the wall and the furnishings below it that should be considered,” she says.',\n",
